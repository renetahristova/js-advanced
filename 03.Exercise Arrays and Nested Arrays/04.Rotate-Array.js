// Write a JS function that rotates an array. The array should be rotated to the right side, meaning that the
// last element should become the first, upon rotation.
// The input comes as two parameters â€“ an array of strings and a number. The second parameter is the
// amount of rotation you need to perform.
// The output is the resulted array after the rotations. The elements should be printed on one line, separated
// by a single space.
