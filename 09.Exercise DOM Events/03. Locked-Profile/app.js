// In this problem, you should create a JS functonality which shows and hides the additional
// information about users.
// When one of the [Show more] buttons is clicked, the hiden information inside the div should
// be shown, only if the profile is not locked! If the current profile is locked, nothing should happen.
// If the hidden information is displayed and we lock the profile again, the [Hide it] button
// should not be working! Otherwise, when the profile is unlocked and we click on the [Hide it]
// button, the new fields must hide again.
